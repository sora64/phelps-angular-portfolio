This is a web development portfolio for me, Alan Phelps, showcasing who I am and the work I have done on personal projects. I have more experience working for clients in a professional setting, but I cannot link to those projects due to confidentiality purposes, but I am happy to talk about the work I did within the guidelines I was given to do so.
